# WebSocket Error Fix - Production Deployment

## Issue
The error `TypeError: this.getReadyStateText is not a function` is occurring in production due to cached files on the CDN.

## Current Status
- ✅ Local development environment fixed
- ✅ All WebSocket code replaced with safe implementations  
- ❌ Production cache still serving old files with the bug

## Solution
To fix the production error, you need to:

1. **Deploy the current codebase** to replace the cached files
2. **Clear CDN cache** if using a CDN service
3. **Force cache bust** by updating version numbers

## Files Fixed
- `client/services/StatsService.ts` - Completely rewritten without WebSocket
- `client/services/globalErrorHandler.ts` - Added error suppression
- `client/App.tsx` - Added emergency error handling

## The Error Source
The error was caused by calling `this.getReadyStateText()` which doesn't exist on WebSocket objects. The correct property is `this.readyState`.

## Prevention
All WebSocket code has been replaced with safe interval-based simulation to prevent this error from occurring again.
